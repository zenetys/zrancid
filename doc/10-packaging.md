### Packaging

The easiest way to install (z)RANCiD is to use our [RPM package](https://github.com/zenetys/rpm-zrancid) if your distribution is supported. The [RPM spec](https://github.com/zenetys/rpm-zrancid/blob/master/SPECS/zrancid.spec) does basically what is explained in the other files of the [doc/](./) directory; it's also a good starting point on understanding how to setup (z)RANCiD.

* Source of the RPM is available in our rpm-zrancid repository:<br/>
  https://github.com/zenetys/rpm-zrancid
* Prebuilt packages are available on ZENETYS yum repositories:<br/>
